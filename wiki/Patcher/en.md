# Titanic! Patcher

Introducing **Titanic! Patcher** - a new way of playing Titanic.  
Instead of downloading a pre-patched version from Titanic's servers, you can now use the original, untouched game files.

Follow the steps below to get everything set up!

## Step 1: Download osu! from Osekai Snapshots

The first step is to obtain the game itself.
Most people use [Osekai Snapshots](https://osekai.net/snapshots/) for this purpose, as it provides a large collection of archived versions.

## Step 2: Download the latest version of Titanic! Patcher

Titanic! Patcher is fully open-source and available for download on the GitHub [Release Page](https://github.com/osuTitanic/hook/releases).  
Find the latest version and download the **Titanic.netxx.exe** file.

Once downloaded, place the *.exe* file into your osu! installation folder and double-click it. That’s it - you’re ready to go!

### Choosing the right .NET Framework version

osu! switched from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0 in 2015.  
- Versions released before 2015 most likely require **.NET 2.0**.  
- Versions released after 2015 most likely require **.NET 4.0**.

If you encounter a *.NET Framework runtime version mismatch!* error when launching the client, simply try the other version of the patcher.
