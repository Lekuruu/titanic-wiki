# Titanic! Patcher

[TOC]

Introducing **Titanic! Patcher** - a new way of playing Titanic.  
Instead of downloading a pre-patched version from Titanic's servers, you can now use the original, untouched game files.

Follow the steps below to get everything set up!

## Step 1: Download osu! from Osekai Snapshots

The first step is to obtain the game itself.
Most people use [Osekai Snapshots](https://osekai.net/snapshots/) for this purpose, as it provides a large collection of archived versions.

## Step 2: Download the latest version of Titanic! Patcher

Titanic! Patcher is fully open-source and available for download on the GitHub [Release Page](https://github.com/osuTitanic/hook/releases).  
Find the latest version and download the **Titanic.netxx.exe** file.

Once downloaded, place the *.exe* file into your osu! installation folder and double-click it. That’s it - you’re ready to go!

### Choosing the right .NET Framework version

It is recommended to use the .NET 4.0 version of the patcher, as it's compatible with every osu! version, saves some headaches, is compatible out of the box with osu-wine, and might provide better performance.

Additionally, there is a .NET 2.0 version of the patcher that's compatible only with versions before the middle of 2015, which might fix some unexpected issues. It also works on very old operating systems (Windows 2000 and Windows XP before Service Pack 2).

### Versions for "testers only"

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osuTitanic/wiki/refs/heads/main/wiki/Patcher/img/testers-only.jpg)

You may see a message saying:  
**"The version of osu! you are using is made for testers only."**.

This simply means that the version you're trying to run has not been tested with Titanic! yet, or it's simply too new to be supported.
