# Rules

Welcome to Titanic, before you get started please read through these rules for a more safe and pleasent experience.

## Community Rules

1. **Each user may only have *one* account ever!** The only exception to this rule is making bot accounts or other projects, but you must first let staff know so we can approve it. If you cannot access your email or you have forgotten your password, please open a support ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server or contact the [support email](mailto:support@titanic.sh).
2. **Play fair.** Using any third party tools that gives you an unfair advantage over people will result in a restriction. This includes programs like macros, cheat engine, aim-assist programs, timewarp, and so on. If you see some suspicious activity from a user, please open up a ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server, or contact the [support email](mailto:support@titanic.sh).  
3. **Be kind to people.** Any harassment, racism or antagonism has no place here in Titanic! This is a server about clicking circles, catching fruit, bashing drums, and breaking keyboards whilst pretending to be Cookiezi and playing old maps, not to be rude to each other.
4. **No NSFW/18+ content.** Any content that contains drug use or topics of a sexual nature are not welcome here. You can keep that to yourself.
5. **Malicious impersonation** of another person is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to pose as someone else with the intent to deceive or harm will result in an immediate restriction. Yes, that means naming yourself "BTMC" and advertising your crypto scam is not allowed.
6. **Modified osu! clients** are permitted on Titanic, but they must receive approval from a server administrator before use. Any attempt to circumvent this requirement will result in a restriction.
7. **Intentional server abuse.** Deliberate attempts to overload, DDoS, or otherwise disrupt Titanic’s servers are strictly prohibited and will lead to an account restriction.
8. **Unsolicited advertisements** are prohibited on Titanic. Any promotional content must be pre‑approved by a staff member before posting. Ignoring this rule may lead to a silenced profile.  
9. **Leaked source code.** Any mention, display, or distribution of osu!’s leaked source code is strictly prohibited. It would only make unnecessary work for peppy.
10. **Minimum age requirement.** All users must be at least 13 years old to join Titanic. Account owners found to be under this age will be suspended until proof of eligibility is provided.
