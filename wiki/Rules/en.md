# Rules

Welcome to Titanic, before you get started please read through these rules for a more safe and pleasant experience.

## Community Rules

1. **Each user may only have *one* account ever!**  
    The only exception to this rule is making bot accounts or other projects, but you must first let staff know so we can approve it. If you cannot access your email or you have forgotten your password, please open a support ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server or contact the [support email](mailto:support@titanic.sh).

2. **Play fair.**  
    Using any third-party tools that gives you an unfair advantage over people will result in a restriction. This includes programs like macros, cheat engine, aim-assist programs, timewarp, and so on. Additionally, exploiting bugs or unintended behavior in a client is strictly prohibited. If you see some suspicious activity from a user, please open up a ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server or contact the [support email](mailto:support@titanic.sh).

3. **Be kind to people.**  
    Any harassment, racism or antagonism has no place here in Titanic! This is a server about clicking circles, catching fruit, bashing drums, and breaking keyboards whilst pretending to be Cookiezi and playing old maps, not to be rude to each other.

4. **No NSFW/18+ content.**  
    Any content that contains drug use or topics of a sexual nature are not welcome here. You can keep that to yourself.

5. **Malicious impersonation**  
    Impersonation of another person is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to pose as someone else with the intent to deceive or harm will result in an immediate restriction. Yes, that means naming yourself "BTMC" and advertising your crypto scam is not allowed.

6. **Modified osu! clients** *are* permitted on Titanic, but they must receive approval from a server administrator before use. Any attempt to circumvent this requirement will result in a restriction.

7. **Intentional server abuse.**  
    Deliberate attempts to overload, DDoS, or otherwise disrupt Titanic’s servers are strictly prohibited and will lead to an account restriction.

8. **Unsolicited advertisements** are prohibited on Titanic. Any promotional content must be pre‑approved by a staff member before posting. Breaking this rule may lead to your account being silenced.

9. **Leaked source code.**  
    Any mention, display, or distribution of osu!’s leaked source code is strictly prohibited. It would only make unnecessary work for peppy.

10. **Minimum age requirement.**  
    All users must be at least 13 years old to join Titanic. Account owners found to be under this age will be suspended until proof of eligibility is provided.

11. **Use common sense.**  
    The staff team has explicit discretion to apply their judgment on this as they see fit.

## In-game Chat Rules

1. **Be respectful and mindful of other users in the channel.**  
    Avoid flooding or spamming. Taking up half the screen by yourself is annoying, so please avoid doing it whenever possible.

2. **If someone gets silenced or restricted, leave them be and don’t start talking about them.**  
    If someone is silenced or restricted, their case is between them and the administrators.

3. **Do not continue to message or harass users after being blocked.**  
    If a user blocks you, it means they no longer wish to communicate. Attempting to bypass the block — especially to harass, disturb, troll, or provoke them — is a serious violation of in-game conduct. This behaviour will lead to silence or other punishments, if someone is harassing you or threatening your safety, please open a support ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server or contact the [support email](mailto:support@titanic.sh).

## Forum-wide Rules

1. **Spamming multiple posts within a single thread is strictly prohibited.**  
    Users must avoid posting repeatedly or flooding a thread with unnecessary or redundant messages. Use the edit button to add to your post when needed. Excessive posting disrupts discussions and may lead to post removal or getting punished.

2. **Do not necro-post in threads that are older than 3 months.**  
    This only applies on General Discussion and Off-Topic sub-forums, reviving old threads without contributing substantial new information disrupts forums may confuse ongoing discussions. If the topic is still relevant, consider starting a new thread instead. Repeated necro-posting may result in warning, if the user keeps necro-posting they'll get silenced.
