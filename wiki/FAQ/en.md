# FAQ

[TOC]

## How can I play?

To get started you can take a look at the [[Installation|installation guide]] or just go to the [downloads page](https://osu.titanic.sh/download/) on our website.

## How do I find beatmaps?

You can download beatmaps via osu!direct or on the [beatmaps page](https://osu.titanic.sh/beatmapsets/) on the website. Downloading maps from the official osu! website works as well.

## My game is feeling slow/laggy, how can I fix that?

Many players face this issue and most often it can be fixed by setting the `RefreshRate` value in the `osu!.yourname.cfg` file, to your monitors refresh rate. If you are still experiencing issues, please try to mess around with the graphics & fps settings, until it feels right! Other versions of the game might also give you a better or worse experience.

## Will RX/AP scores be submitted?

Yes, we are supporting the Relax and Autopilot mods, with one noticeable difference from other servers: Rankings for Vanilla, Relax, and Autopilot are merged together, since they do give PP and score, but not as much compared to Vanilla to keep things fair.

## How can I submit a beatmap?

There are two options for this:

- Submit your own beatmap from the editor in-game
- Request a map from the official osu! [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) to the [Map Requests](https://osu.titanic.sh/forum/11) subforum.
